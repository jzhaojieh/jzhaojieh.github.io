<p>For this project, I developed an online platform for users to register for chess camps. I initially designed and implemented the backend SQLite database before creating models, views, and controllers for the appropriate actors in the application. I also incorporated TDD through unit tests for models and cucumber tests for views that helped ensure code coverage along with functional correctness.</p>
