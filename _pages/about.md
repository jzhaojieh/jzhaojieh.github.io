I am currently a senior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Information Systems and Business Administration. 

The past summer, I worked as an application developer for Boeing on the Product Systems team, adding full stack features to a 3D product imaging application. Prior to that, I worked as an application developer for SPI Lasers, standing up a desktop application to automate obsolete processes.
